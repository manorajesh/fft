# Fast Fourier Tranform
<p>This is a simple script that receives audio input from the standard input device (with PyAudio) then computes a FFT on one of the channels of audio. The output is then plotted with matplotlib</p>

#### This is not entirely my own idea; I used a few different sources and added them together. The PyAudio input is from their [documentation](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#docs), and the FFT computation is from [Eugene Klyshko](https://klyshko.github.io/teaching/2019-02-22-teaching)
